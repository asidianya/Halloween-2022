# Set up the packages we need

# Load the data

We're are loading the data from last year's Halloween TidyTuesday dataset. You can see the information about this dataset here: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-10-22. 

```{r}
#install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
defaultW <- getOption("warn") 

options(warn = -1) 

horror_movies <- readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2019/2019-10-22/horror_movies.csv")
glimpse(horror_movies)
```

# Cleaning up the data

Among missing observations there are transformations we should make on the variables pertaining to dates (days, months, years, etc.) to make them functional. 

At times (i.e. most of the tutorial) we will make use of the tidyverse pipeline that allows us to manipulation or variables without having to use the built in slower base R commands.

Tip: The keyboard short cut to make a pipe (%>%) is Cmd+Shift+M on Mac and Ctrl+Shift+M on PC. 

#Example: #adapted from https://github.com/IEORTools/tidytuesday/blob/master/horror_movies.R

Among the variables in `horror_movies` are:

```{r}
#install.packages("lubridate")
library(lubridate)
defaultW <- getOption("warn") 

options(warn = -1) 

attach(horror_movies)
budget_nm <- gsub("[[:punct:]]","",budget)
budget_nm <- as.numeric(budget_nm)

#substr(variable, start, stop) is a way to extract the dollar units from the budget
budget_MU <- substr(budget,1,1)
budget_MU

log_budget_nm <- log(budget_nm)
horror_temp<-horror_movies %>% add_column(budget_nm, log_budget_nm)


horror_temp <- horror_temp[which(budget_MU=="$"),]
head(horror_temp[,c("budget_nm","review_rating")])
glimpse(horror_temp)
```

Question:

1. What does the gsub() function do to the budget variable? 

### Creating a ggplot

Consider the two variables we are working with from above: 

1. `review_rating`, a movie's rating from 0 to 10.

2. `budget`, Budget (sub-setted by US dollars/EUROs, etc.).

The first argument of `ggplot()` is the dataset to use in the graph. All we have created is a coordinate system. Without specifying another layer to the plot, we essentially have an empty plot. 

```{r}
ggplot(horror_temp, aes(x=review_rating, y=budget_nm)) 
```

We add things to the plot with `+`. For a scatter plot, we use `geom_point()` and then we add features to our plot, such as the title and axes labels. Let's try and plot the scatter plot for the review ratings vs. the budget. 

```{r}

ggplot(horror_temp, aes(x=review_rating, y=budget_nm)) +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Tidy Tuesday Horror Movie Ratings vs Budget") +
  ylab("Budget") +
  xlab("Movie Rating")
```

The scale of measurement is too large for budget. We may be better off looking at the log of budget. Here plot `review_rating` on the x-axis and `log(budget)` transformation on the y-axis:

```{r}
#check the budget on the log scale

ggplot(horror_temp, aes(x=review_rating, y=log(budget_nm))) +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Tidy Tuesday Horror Movie Ratings vs Budget") +
  ylab("log(Budget)") +
  xlab("Movie Rating")
```

The plot shows that the 'log(Budget)' and 'movie rating' does not appear to be strongly related as they seem to be randomly distributed across our plot. In other words, within the context of dollars ($), it does not appear that budgets are correlated with the horror movie ratings. 

##Exercises

#Let's glimpse at our data. What could have mentioned earlier is that ggplot is a feature inside of tidyverse, but you can also install it externally. 
```{r}
#install.packages("ggplot2")
library(tidyverse)

glimpse(horror_movies)
view(horror_movies)

#?help(lm)
```
Have a look at the descriptions for each of the variables. https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-10-22

1.  Run `ggplot(data = horror_movies)`. What do you see?
```{r}
ggplot(data=horror_movies)
```

Again, we have a blank plot and we have given a dataframe, not variables, to plot.

2.  How many rows are in `horror_movies`? How many columns?
```{r}
dim(horror_movies)
```

We check the dimensions of our dataset to see that we have 3328 rows and 12 columns. 

3.    How many levels does `release_country` variable have?  Glimpse at  the`release_country` to find out.

```{r, message=FALSE}
defaultW <- getOption("warn") 

options(warn = -1) 
glimpse(language)
language= as.factor(horror_movies$release_country)
```

4. Let's  make a boxplot for 'release date' versus 'frequency' per month.
```{r}
library(lubridate)
horror_movies <- horror_movies %>% 
  # Ignore any NA release dates
  filter(!is.na(release_date)) %>% 
  # Transform our dates to be the month
  mutate(month = month(dmy(release_date), label=T, abbr=F)) %>% 
  # Remove if month is unknown
  filter(!is.na(month))

#movies released per country
total_country = horror_movies %>% 
  count(release_country, name="total_country")

# create the data frame for release month vs country (further breaking down the data)
horror_movies_month = horror_movies %>% 
  count(release_country, month) %>% 

  #From help(left_join): The mutating joins add columns from y to x, matching rows based on the keys. Merge totals  by adding columns from y to x per month and country
  left_join(total_country) %>%
  
  # Filter: take only countries with more than 5 movie releases into account
  filter(total_country >= 5) %>% 
  mutate(percentage = n / total_country) # We want the percentage of releases for each country
  
  #Let's see what we have created
  view(horror_movies_month)
```

Now, let's plot the dataframe that we have created. We add one more feature to our plot to rotate the x-axes labels so that they are vertical. This makes it easier to read them without having each month overlapping the next. 
```{r}
ggplot(data=horror_movies_month, aes(x=month, y=percentage, fill=reorder(month, total_country, sum))) + geom_boxplot() +
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle = -90, hjust = 0))
```

 5. What if we want to look at the percentages for countries with at least 10 release dates?  Change the box plot accordingly. 
 
If we wanted to do this, we would simply update `filter(total_country >= 5)` to `filter(total_country >= 10)`. 

6. What happens if you  want to make a boxplot of `percent` vs `month` for Spain? Hint: How can you use filters to your benefit here?

```{r}
horror_movies_spain <- horror_movies_month %>% filter(release_country == "Spain")
glimpse(horror_movies_spain)  
```
```{r}
ggplot(data=horror_movies_spain, aes(x=month, y=percentage, fill=reorder(month, total_country, sum))) + geom_boxplot()
```

We can see from our data, we have less data for spain so our box plot is much smaller than our overall data.

##Aesethetic mappings/Features 

>#Allow us to take a closer look at potentially missing information, such as outliers. 

```{r}
ggplot(horror_temp, aes(x=review_rating, y=budget_nm))+
  geom_point() + 
  geom_point(data = filter(horror_temp, review_rating > 5, budget_nm > 1.0e+08), colour = "red", size = 2.2) + ggtitle("Tidy Tuesday Horror Movie Ratings vs Budget") +
  ylab("Budget") +
  xlab("Movie Rating")
```
You can add a third variable, like `genre`, to a two dimensional boxplot by mapping it to an aesthetic.  Aesthetics include things like the size, the shape, or the color of your plots. For example, let's suppose we wanted to know the budget of each  movie rating (in US dollars)  changed for each month. Further suppose we wanted to know whether certain movie ratings had higher budgets. 

You can convey information about your data by mapping the aesthetics in your plot to the variables in your dataset. For example, we can map a colour to the  `movie_rating` to reveal the budget for each movie rating.

````{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(scales)
library(lubridate)
movies <-horror_movies  %>%  mutate(release_parsed = parse_date(release_date,
                                     format = "%d-%b-%y") )
#if the movies release parsed is na then take the movies release date  already expressed as years
#Otherwise take the release date_date which is in years
movies <- movies %>% mutate(years=ifelse(is.na(release_parsed),
                             release_date,
                              year(release_parsed))) %>% 
  mutate(movies,month = month.abb[month(movies$release_parsed)]) %>%
  mutate(budget_m= as.numeric(gsub("[[:punct:]]","",budget))) 


budget_MU <- substr(movies$budget,1,1)


movies_h<- movies[which(budget_MU=="$"),]

movies_h %>% 
  group_by(month, movie_rating) %>% 
  summarize(revenue=sum(budget_m)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(month, revenue)) + 
  geom_col(aes(fill=movie_rating)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels=dollar_format()) + 
  
  scale_fill_manual("legend", values = c("E" = "yellow", "NOT RATED" = "orange", 
                                         "PG" = "black", "PG-13"="brown","R"="gold", 
                                         "TV-14"="gray", "TV-MA"="red", "UNRATED"="Wheat",
                                         "NA=pink1")) +
  labs(x="", y="movie budget", title="Worldwide Film Budget by month")

```
For the month of October it seems as that the budget is greater for almost all movie ratings. However, the budget is higher for rated R movies. This is true for US dollars; the trend may differ for EUROs  (difference audience).

#Challenge: Replace $(dollars) by euros to determine if there is a difference in  budgets across the different months (and movie ratings). 

```{r}
#Hint we may want to change the units of this variable.   
#movies_h<- movies[which(budget_MU=="$"),]
```


## Facets

One way to add additional variables is with aesthetics. Another way, particularly useful for categorical variables, is to split your plot into facets, subplots that each display one subset of the data. 

To facet your plot by a single variable, use `facet_wrap()`. The first argument of `facet_wrap()` should be a formula, which is the name of your data structure that you wish to subset on. Thus variable that you pass to `facet_wrap()` should be discrete.  


```{r}
movies <-horror_movies  %>%  mutate(release_parsed = parse_date(release_date,
                                     format = "%d-%b-%y") )


movies <- movies %>% mutate(years = ifelse( is.na(release_parsed),release_date, year(release_parsed) ),
                            month_num = ifelse( is.na(release_parsed),release_date, month(release_parsed) )) %>% 
  mutate(movies,month = month.abb[month(movies$release_parsed)]) %>%
  mutate(budget_m= as.numeric(gsub("[[:punct:]]","",budget))) 


budget_MU <- substr(movies$budget,1,1)
movies_h<- movies[which(budget_MU=="$"),] %>% arrange(month_num)


movies_i <- movies_h %>% 
  mutate(month_num = as.factor(month_num)) %>% 
  group_by(month, month_num, movie_rating) %>% 
  summarize(revenue=mean(budget_m)) %>% 
  arrange(month_num)

movies_i %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = fct_inorder(month), revenue)) + 
  geom_col(aes(fill=movie_rating)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels=dollar_format()) + 
  
  scale_fill_manual("legend", values = c("E" = "yellow", "NOT RATED" = "orange", 
                                         "PG" = "black", "PG-13"="brown","R"="gold", 
                                         "TV-14"="gray", "TV-MA"="red", "UNRATED"="Wheat",
                                         "NA"="darkgray")) +
  labs(x="", y="movie budget", title="Worldwide Film Budget by month")  + facet_wrap(~movie_rating, scales = "free_y") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = -45, vjust = 0))
  # scale_x_discrete(limits=movies_i$month)
```

#In American films rated R films tend to have the highest budget. 

Question:

1.  What does the plot above tell us about the budget (in dollars) for each each movie rating type? Note this is most likely USA when we subset based on dollars. 

Facet wrap is just a feature we add at the end of the ggplot operations. We can do a facet wrap of other types of plots as well.
```{r, fig.height=9}
ggplot(data=movies_h, aes(x=movie_rating, y=review_rating, fill= movie_rating )) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  facet_wrap(~fct_inorder(month), scales = "free_y") + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = -90, vjust = 0))
```

```{r}
movies_h$movie_run_time <- as.numeric(gsub("min","", movies_h$movie_run_time))
```

```{r, fig.height=9}

ggplot(data=movies_h, aes(x=movie_run_time, color = movie_rating, fill = movie_rating )) + 
  geom_density(alpha = 0.4) + 
  facet_wrap(~fct_inorder(month), scales = "free_y") + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 0, vjust = 0))
```
